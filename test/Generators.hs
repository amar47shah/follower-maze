-- | Generates a correctly formed raw event.

-- | Internal only. Returns a generator for raw events
-- with the given sequence number.

-- | Internal only. Generates a sequence number between @1@ and the value
-- of `Config.totalEvents`.
sequenceNumber :: QC.Gen SequenceNumber
sequenceNumber = QC.choose (1, toInteger totalEvents)

-- | Internal only. Returns a generator for raw events meeting the given
-- specifications. Most combinations of event code and user id count
-- result in generators that produce invalid, unparseable raw events.

-- | Generates an `EventQueue` with 0 or more raw events enqueued
-- using the `enqueueRaw` operation.
--
-- The following cases are generated in a weighted (9:3:3:1) distribution:
--
-- * a correctly loaded queue containing events with no duplicate
--   sequence numbers, and set to dequeue events with sequence numbers
--   less than or equal to @1@.
-- * an "offset" queue containing no duplicate events, but possibly
--   containing events with smaller sequence numbers than its next expected
--   sequence number (which is larger than @1@). That is, an offset queue
--   may contain events that it __should__ have dequeued already.
-- * a non-offset queue that may contain events with duplicate sequence numbers.
-- * an offset queue that may contain events with duplicate sequence numbers.

alignedNewQueue :: QC.Gen EventQueue
alignedNewQueue = pure emptyQueue

-- | Internal only. Generates an empty queue set to dequeue events up to some
-- small sequence number /larger than @1@/.
offsetNewQueue :: QC.Gen EventQueue
offsetNewQueue = newQueueAt <$> QC.choose (2, smallNum)

-- | Internal only. Generates a list of 0 or more __unique__,
-- unordered sequence numbers from @1@ up to some small sequence number.
withoutDuplicates :: QC.Gen [SequenceNumber]
withoutDuplicates = QC.sublistOf =<< QC.shuffle [1..smallNum]

-- | Internal only. Generates a list of 0 or more __possibly non-unique__,
-- unordered sequence numbers from @1@ up to some small sequence number.
withDuplicates :: QC.Gen [SequenceNumber]
withDuplicates = QC.listOf $ QC.choose (1, smallNum)

-- | Internal only. To test `EventQueue`s, it is helpful to keep the
-- maximum sequence number of enqeued events low so that the generated queue
-- will be more likely to contain immediately dequeueable events.
